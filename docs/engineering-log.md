# Engineering log — todos, tech debt, findings, deferred items

A low-ceremony running log for things we hit *during* other work and don't want to stop
for: **todos**, **tech debt / sketchy things** (including soundness-scope caveats),
**findings** (surprises worth remembering), and **deferred** items (punted to a later
milestone, with a reason). See something mid-task → add a bullet under the right section,
keep going. The point is to not interrupt the main task, and to not lose the thread either.

This is the *general* log. Two siblings own narrower scopes — cross-referenced, never
duplicated: [`docs/proofs/ledger.md`](proofs/ledger.md) (formal proof obligations, Lean/Kani
status per checker) and [`../vv-matrix.md`](../vv-matrix.md) (the V&V coverage matrix,
CI-gated).

**How to add an entry:** a bold one-line title, a sentence or two of substance, then a
trailing italic line `date · status · ref`. Status ∈ `open · deferred(→Mx) · watching ·
resolved`. On resolve, move the bullet to **Resolved** at the bottom, keeping its date and a
one-line outcome. New sections (e.g. a **To do** that grows, or a per-milestone bucket) are
fine — this is a log, not a schema.

## To do

- **Restore the `Backend` associated-type `Clone + Eq` bounds when Charon disambiguates
  trait parent-clauses.** The pinned Charon (`0.1.225`) lifts the `Backend` trait to a Lean
  `structure` whose parent-clause witnesses for *both* associated types (`type Int: Clone + Eq`
  and `type Rat: Clone + Eq`) are named identically (`corecloneCloneInst` / `corecmpEqInst`),
  so the structure has duplicate fields and does not typecheck — which blocks lifting any
  `Rat`-using checker (all `<B: Backend>`). Investigated exhaustively: no charon flag fixes it
  (`--remove-adt-clauses` targets ADTs not trait decls; `--exclude` leaves a dangling `sorry`
  and collapses the assoc-type lifting; `--hide-allocator` / `--opaque` variants keep the
  colliding structure). **Workaround (algebra-rehaul R.3):** dropped the `Clone + Eq` bounds
  from the trait's associated types (`Eq` was unused; `Clone` had exactly 4 call sites in
  `rat.rs`) and expressed clone as explicit `Backend::int_clone` / `rat_clone` methods (one impl,
  `Bignum`). This is contained and semantically inert, but it is a workaround: when Charon names
  those witnesses distinctly (check its releases past `0.1.225`), restore the associated-type
  bounds, delete `int_clone`/`rat_clone` + their impl, revert the 4 `rat.rs` sites to `.clone()`,
  and re-extract. Coordinated with a charon/aeneas pin bump (drags Lean/Mathlib). *2026-08-04 · open*

- **Make the dylint CI step fenix-native.** `cargo dylint`'s toolchain management is
  rustup-centric — it reads `lints/no_float/rust-toolchain` and runs that nightly *via rustup* —
  so the CI step (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on the **runner's rustup, outside nix** (like
  the Kani `cargo install` step) rather than a fenix-pinned toolchain. Functional and verified
  locally, but not consistent with the rest of the toolchain (fenix / `flake.nix`). Follow-up:
  supply `nightly-2026-05-28` + `rustc-dev`/`llvm-tools` via `fenix.toolchainOf` and run dylint
  inside `nix develop` — needs a rustup shim or dylint toolchain-env plumbing (the fiddly part
  I couldn't verify from the sandbox). Also: watch the first real CI run of the step.

- **Pin `nixpkgs` off `nixos-unstable`.** `flake.nix` floats `nixos-unstable`, so a toolchain
  bump silently regresses CI with **no code change** — e.g. `gcc-15.3`/`glibc-2.42` emitting a
  `.debug_gdb_scripts` section that `rust-lld` rejected when linking the CGAL oracle shim (worked
  around with `.debug(false)` in `crates/difftest/build.rs`, commit `5276957`). Pin to a
  known-good rev (or a stable release) so CI is reproducible; the `.debug(false)` band-aid can
  then be reconsidered. Revisit floating-vs-pinned deliberately.

## Tech debt / sketchy

- **The mesh κ-cap corner-min is representation-conditional.** It is sound only while `R₁`
  is affine/monotone in the chart parameters. Before promoting it to a *general* κ-cap
  checker (milestone C — the petal flank, where `R₁` is neither), Sturm-isolate the
  curvature extrema over the domain, or carry a certified convexity/monotonicity rider. This
  is the same class as the CLIP-σ / `corner_range` convexity rider. The cone golden is
  hand-verified, not unsound.

- **The invariant lints scan code/doc-comments only, not spec text.** `tuple-predicate` and
  `:= census` (now in `cargo xtask lint`) should also scan `spec/`, but that needs an
  allow-list for the frozen spec's own meta-discussion of the rules (it explains *why*
  "proportional" is banned, using the word), and the spec is frozen — so we can't sprinkle
  inline allow markers. Deferred until that allow-list is designed.

## Findings

- **Developable ≠ constant curvature.** A cone's nonzero principal radius is `R₁ = ρ·tan β`
  (ρ = slant distance from the apex) — *not* constant; only the cylinder has constant `κ₁`.
  This is why the mesh κ-cap is the domain minimum (the tightest radius, nearest the apex),
  not a value read off a fixed parameter station. A one-line property test caught the wrong
  "cone ⇒ symmetric ⇒ constant radius" assumption.

## Deferred (by milestone)

- **Petal conical-flank fixture + the `cx-cone-flank-trim-mu` corpus entry.** Spec §13
  geometry is not yet pinned; needed for closure/sew.

- **Algebra-trust rehaul.** Opaque `Int=ℤ` / `Rat=ℚ`, a reference bignum, its Lean
  equivalence proof, and a dashu differential stress-test.

- **The full EDGE-REG verdict logic + EDGE-EMB / EDGE-EDGE (embeddedness).** The Milestone-B
  version is only the `Pass | Fail | Stall` core plus `to_verdict`.
  *2026-08-04 · deferred(→M5/sew) · `certify1d::edge_reg`*

- **M0 `lattice` perf/robustness follow-ups.** Subresultant PRS (vs the naive resultant), a
  bivariate resultant, `AlgReal` refinement, proportional-lint softening.

## Frontier (research-open)

- **Two open theorems, both tracked in the proof ledger.** Sturm's theorem is cited as an
  axiom (`sturm_root_count`, absent from Mathlib); CAP-OUT ⇒ 2-manifold-with-boundary is
  open. Runtime-checked hypotheses / bounded Kani cover soundness in the interim.

## Resolved

- **Launder the bench build-artifact blobs out of git history.** *Done 2026-08-04:* rewrote
  `main` + `milestone-b` with `git filter-branch --index-filter` (filter-repo unavailable),
  stripping all 853 `benchmarks/two-tier-vs-dashu/target/` blobs — branch histories clean, the
  milestone merge + tree intact, `cargo build` green. Objects survive only via the
  `refs/original` backup + a bundle (won't be pushed; gc when convenient). The rewritten `main`
  still descends from `gho/main`, so the push was a clean fast-forward.

- **Push the laundered `main` to `gho`.** *Done 2026-08-04:* the remote fast-forwarded
  `c2a73c4 → 98005ea` (Milestone B + engineering-log + tidy Phases A/B), verified blob-free.

- **dylint `no_float` lint (float literals in certified paths).** *Done 2026-08-04:* a
  `rustc_private` `LateLintPass` (`lints/no_float`, pinned `nightly-2026-05-28`) flags float
  *literals* in `lattice`/`certify_core`/`arrange2d` — the type-aware complement to the
  `cargo xtask lint` token scan. Verified locally: compiles clean, the UI test fires on
  `1.5`/`2.0`/`3.0`, and the real certified crates are float-literal-free (it correctly ignores
  the `.1.0` tuple access at `boolean.rs:550`, where a text scan would false-flag `1.0`). CI
  wiring is written but pending a real-runner check (see To do).
