# Engineering log — todos, tech debt, findings, deferred items

A low-ceremony running log for things we hit *during* other work and don't want to stop
for: **todos**, **tech debt / sketchy things** (including soundness-scope caveats),
**findings** (surprises worth remembering), and **deferred** items (punted to a later
milestone, with a reason). See something mid-task → add a bullet under the right section,
keep going. The point is to not interrupt the main task, and to not lose the thread either.

This is the *general* log. Two siblings own narrower scopes — cross-referenced, never
duplicated: [`docs/proofs/ledger.md`](proofs/ledger.md) (formal proof obligations, Lean/Kani
status per checker) and [`../vv-matrix.md`](../vv-matrix.md) (the V&V coverage matrix,
CI-gated).

**How to add an entry:** a bold one-line title, a sentence or two of substance, then a
trailing italic line `date · status · ref`. Status ∈ `open · deferred(→Mx) · watching ·
resolved`. On resolve, move the bullet to **Resolved** at the bottom, keeping its date and a
one-line outcome. New sections (e.g. a **To do** that grows, or a per-milestone bucket) are
fine — this is a log, not a schema.

## To do

- **Verify the dylint CI step on a real runner.** The `cargo dylint` step (rustup nightly,
  outside nix — `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) is written and verified *locally*, but couldn't be
  run on GitHub Actions from the dev sandbox. Watch the first CI run of the branch; tune if the
  runner env differs (toolchain/component fetch, `cargo-dylint` install time, package scoping).

## Tech debt / sketchy

- **The mesh κ-cap corner-min is representation-conditional.** It is sound only while `R₁`
  is affine/monotone in the chart parameters. Before promoting it to a *general* κ-cap
  checker (milestone C — the petal flank, where `R₁` is neither), Sturm-isolate the
  curvature extrema over the domain, or carry a certified convexity/monotonicity rider. This
  is the same class as the CLIP-σ / `corner_range` convexity rider. The cone golden is
  hand-verified, not unsound.

- **The invariant lints scan code/doc-comments only, not spec text.** `tuple-predicate` and
  `:= census` (now in `cargo xtask lint`) should also scan `spec/`, but that needs an
  allow-list for the frozen spec's own meta-discussion of the rules (it explains *why*
  "proportional" is banned, using the word), and the spec is frozen — so we can't sprinkle
  inline allow markers. Deferred until that allow-list is designed.

## Findings

- **Developable ≠ constant curvature.** A cone's nonzero principal radius is `R₁ = ρ·tan β`
  (ρ = slant distance from the apex) — *not* constant; only the cylinder has constant `κ₁`.
  This is why the mesh κ-cap is the domain minimum (the tightest radius, nearest the apex),
  not a value read off a fixed parameter station. A one-line property test caught the wrong
  "cone ⇒ symmetric ⇒ constant radius" assumption.

## Deferred (by milestone)

- **Petal conical-flank fixture + the `cx-cone-flank-trim-mu` corpus entry.** Spec §13
  geometry is not yet pinned; needed for closure/sew.
  *2026-08-04 · deferred(→M-C) · `fixtures/corpus.md`*

- **Algebra-trust rehaul.** Opaque `Int=ℤ` / `Rat=ℚ`, a reference bignum, its Lean
  equivalence proof, and a dashu differential stress-test.
  *2026-08-04 · deferred(post-B) · `docs/algebra-trust.md`*

- **SLAB-S1 / QPOS Bernstein positivity.** No Bernstein primitive yet.
  *2026-08-04 · deferred(→M4) · vv-guide §8 (B deferrals)*

- **The full EDGE-REG verdict logic + EDGE-EMB / EDGE-EDGE (embeddedness).** The Milestone-B
  version is only the `Pass | Fail | Stall` core plus `to_verdict`.
  *2026-08-04 · deferred(→M5/sew) · `certify1d::edge_reg`*

- **M0 `lattice` perf/robustness follow-ups.** Subresultant PRS (vs the naive resultant), a
  bivariate resultant, `AlgReal` refinement, proportional-lint softening.
  *2026-08-04 · deferred · M0 task-2 deferrals*

## Frontier (research-open)

- **Two open theorems, both tracked in the proof ledger.** Sturm's theorem is cited as an
  axiom (`sturm_root_count`, absent from Mathlib); CAP-OUT ⇒ 2-manifold-with-boundary is
  open. Runtime-checked hypotheses / bounded Kani cover soundness in the interim.

## Resolved

- **Launder the bench build-artifact blobs out of git history.** *Done 2026-08-04:* rewrote
  `main` + `milestone-b` with `git filter-branch --index-filter` (filter-repo unavailable),
  stripping all 853 `benchmarks/two-tier-vs-dashu/target/` blobs — branch histories clean, the
  milestone merge + tree intact, `cargo build` green. Objects survive only via the
  `refs/original` backup + a bundle (won't be pushed; gc when convenient). The rewritten `main`
  still descends from `gho/main`, so the push was a clean fast-forward.

- **Push the laundered `main` to `gho`.** *Done 2026-08-04:* the remote fast-forwarded
  `c2a73c4 → 98005ea` (Milestone B + engineering-log + tidy Phases A/B), verified blob-free.

- **dylint `no_float` lint (float literals in certified paths).** *Done 2026-08-04:* a
  `rustc_private` `LateLintPass` (`lints/no_float`, pinned `nightly-2026-05-28`) flags float
  *literals* in `lattice`/`certify_core`/`arrange2d` — the type-aware complement to the
  `cargo xtask lint` token scan. Verified locally: compiles clean, the UI test fires on
  `1.5`/`2.0`/`3.0`, and the real certified crates are float-literal-free (it correctly ignores
  the `.1.0` tuple access at `boolean.rs:550`, where a text scan would false-flag `1.0`). CI
  wiring is written but pending a real-runner check (see To do).
