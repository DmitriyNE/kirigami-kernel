//! The **cut-fit certificate** — G2: certify that a proposed rational ruling-rail
//! `μ̂(σ)` traces a cutting surface `{F(X) = 0}` on the cone, so it can enter the
//! certified unroll/anchor pipeline as a genuine cut curve.
//!
//! A rail point `C(σ, μ̂(σ)) = pedal(σ) + μ̂(σ)·ruling(σ) + w·normal(σ)` is **on the
//! cone by construction**; the only obligation is that it also lies on the cut
//! *surface*. So the certificate is a **geometric-distance bound**
//! `sup_σ dist(C(σ, μ̂(σ)), {F=0}) ≤ ε`, gated by the DRC `ε < clearance/2`
//! (spec:192) — "on the surface ∧ on the cone ⟹ on the cut curve". It is the
//! rational sibling of [`crate::anchor::anchor_dev`]: same scaffolding (subdivide
//! the σ-span, interval-enclose, take `ε = max`, DRC), but the residual is
//! **purely rational in σ** — no `cos`/`sin`/`arctan` development — so it reuses
//! only the rational interval primitives, never the transcendental ones.
//!
//! Two surface kinds cover the Stage-1 cuts (the 3-D lift of
//! [`certify_core::cap_in`]'s `Carrier` line/circle): an **offset plane**
//! `{n·X = d}` — whose exact rail [`plane_cut_rail`] is *rational*, verified with
//! `ε ≈ 0` — and a **cylinder**, whose cone∩cylinder rail is a surd fitted by a
//! float oracle (`export::cut_oracle`) and re-verified here. Fail-closed: a loose
//! fit or wrong branch yields a large `ε` ⇒ [`Unresolved`](Verdict::Unresolved),
//! never a wrong [`Verified`](Verdict::Verified). No float enters this certificate.

/// `{F = 0}` meets the ball, within `|F(X)|/g` of `X`.
///
/// *Proof.* Take `F(X) > 0` (the other sign mirrors, `F(X) = 0` is trivial). Follow
/// `Y' = −∇F(Y)/|∇F(Y)|²`, so `F(Y(s)) = F(X) − s` falls at unit rate while the path advances at
/// speed `1/|∇F| ≤ 1/g`. For `s ≤ F(X) ≤ gR` the path has gone at most `s/g ≤ R`, so it is still in
/// the ball and the solution continues; at `s = F(X)` it stands on `{F = 0}`, at most `F(X)/g`
/// from `X`. ∎
///
/// ## Why the hypothesis is free, and why `R` is searched
///
/// The lemma needs `|F|/g ≤ R` — the bound must fit inside the ball it was derived in — and the
/// largest `R` worth trying is `clearance/2`, since a bound bigger than that fails the caller's DRC
/// gate anyway. So the hypothesis holds on precisely the runs that end in `Verified`: a bound too
/// weak to satisfy it is a bound too weak to pass the gate, and nothing is certified on a
/// hypothesis that failed.

/// Within that ceiling, `R` is **searched from small upward**, because `g` is a minimum over the
/// ball and a smaller ball has a larger one. A rail that really is on the surface has a tiny `|F|`
/// and succeeds at the smallest `R` on the first try; only a rail on its way to `Unresolved` pays
/// for the search. Reporting the largest `R` that happened to work would be sound but would inflate
/// ε by the ratio of the clearance to the true error, which is the whole quantity being measured.
///
/// The bound is *self-validating*: it never has to be told that `M` really describes a cone. A
/// quadric with no real points, or none nearby, cannot pass, because the hypotheses it would need
/// are the ones that fail.
///
/// ## What it will not certify
///
/// The ball has to avoid the surface's **singular locus** — a cone's apex, a cylinder's axis —
/// because `∇F` dies there. Since the ball must be at least as big as the bound it carries, this
/// bites when a cut's error is an appreciable fraction of the feature's own radius: measured on the
/// device's `R = 1/5` drill, an error of `5·10⁻⁴` certifies at a factor `1.4` off the exact
/// distance, while an error of `6·10⁻²` — a chord across a third of the hole — cannot be bounded at
/// all and reads `Unresolved`. That is the honest verdict rather than a defect: at that scale the
/// distance to the surface is no longer a first-order quantity, and the cut wants re-authoring, not
/// a looser certificate.
///
/// ## The nappe
///
/// The zero the lemma finds lies in the ball, so bounding the distance to `{F = 0}` bounds the
/// distance to the **authored nappe** only if the whole ball is on that nappe's side. That is one
/// extra enclosure — the selector over the same inflated box — and it discharges both
/// `docs/cutter-extrude-design.md` §4.1 conditions at once: a band reaching the mirror nappe fails
/// it, and so does a band reaching the apex, which sits on the selector's own boundary plane.
